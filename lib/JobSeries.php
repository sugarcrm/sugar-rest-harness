/**
 * JobSeries
 *
 * This abstract class allows you to run multiple jobs in one call (a "series" of jobs)
 * within the same scope. The idea is that your specific implementation of JobSeries
 * will define a run() method. In that method, you can run jobs with the runJob()
 * method, store those results, and then pass specific values from that job's results
 * to another job. Or loop over one job's results, and run another job for every result
 * from the first job. You can perform any operations you like in run(). Here is a 
 * simple example:
 *
 * $results = $this->runJob('Jobs/Contacts/Search.php');
 * foreach ($results->results->records as $record) {
 *     $options = array(
 *        'bean_id' => $record->id,
 *        'post' => array(
 *            'title' => 'Skillful Coder',
 *         ),
 *     );
 *     $this->processOptions($options);
 *     $this->runJob('Jobs/Contacts/Update.php');
 * }
 *
